            "3. Model Predictions:\n",
            "\n",
            "The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) provide model predictions that forecast the storm's path, intensity, and potential impacts. By combining these models, we can improve our accuracy and confidence in predicting the hurricane's trajectory.\n",

The storm is expected to intensify as it approaches the coast, with sustained winds of 120-130 mph (195-215 km/h) and heavy rainfall.\n",

            "**Predicted Impact:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The predicted impact of the hurricane includes:\n",
            "\n",
            "* Heavy rainfall: 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) in some areas, leading to flash flooding, urban flooding, and potential waterborne illnesses.\n",
            "* Storm surge: 2-4 feet (60-120 cm), causing coastal erosion, property damage, and potential power outages.\n",
            "* Strong winds: Gusts of up to 130 mph (215 km/h), potentially causing widespread damage to trees, buildings, and infrastructure.\n",
            "* Power outages: Heavy rainfall and strong winds could lead to power outages affecting tens of thousands of homes and businesses.\n",

            "**Preparations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "To prepare for the hurricane's impact, authorities should:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Issue timely evacuation orders for coastal areas and flood-prone zones.\n",
            "2. Implement storm surge protection measures along the coast, such as sandbags and sea walls.\n",
            "3. Distribute emergency supplies, including food, water, and medical equipment.\n",
            "4. Activate emergency response teams and coordinate with local governments to respond to potential emergencies.\n",

            "Raw Llama Response: Based on the provided historical data, current observations, and model predictions, it's challenging to make a definitive forecast without specific details about the current hurricane. However, I can provide some general insights and factors to consider.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Most Likely Path:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Storm Surge:** The storm surge, which is the rise in sea level due to the hurricane, will play a significant role in determining the path of the hurricane. Historically, storms tend to move westward or northwestward along the coast.\n",
            "2. **Wind Direction:** The wind direction can also influence the path of the hurricane. If the winds are blowing from the south, it may lead to a more northeasterly trajectory, while southerly winds might result in a more westerly movement.\n",
            "3. **Ocean Currents:** The Gulf Stream and other ocean currents can also impact the storm's path. These currents can steer the hurricane westward or northwestward along the coast.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Most Likely Impact:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Storm Surge:** The storm surge will be the most significant threat to coastal areas, causing flooding, erosion, and damage.\n",
            "2. **Wind Damage:** Strong winds will cause widespread power outages, property damage, and disruption of transportation systems.\n",
            "3. **Heavy Rainfall:** Heavy rainfall can lead to flash flooding, landslides, and soil erosion.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Important Considerations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Model Uncertainty:** Keep in mind that model predictions are subject to error and uncertainty. The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) models might predict a different path than the National Hurricane Center (NHC) models.\n",
            "2. **Timing:** The timing of the storm's arrival will also play a significant role in determining its impact. A storm that arrives during the night or at dawn may cause less damage and disruption compared to one that hits during the day.\n",
            "3. **Preparations:** The effectiveness of evacuation plans, emergency preparedness measures, and infrastructure resilience can significantly influence the overall impact of the hurricane.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Conclusion:**\n",
            "\n",
            "While it's impossible to provide a definitive forecast without more specific information, I've highlighted some key factors to consider when predicting the path and impact of the hurricane. It's essential to closely monitor current observations, model predictions, and historical data to make an informed decision about the most likely path and impact of the hurricane.\n",

            "* Radar data shows the storm's outer rainbands are extending into the Gulf of Mexico, indicating a potential landfall in Texas or Louisiana.\n",

            "**Historical Data:**\n",
            "\n",
