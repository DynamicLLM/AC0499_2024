      "\n",
      "## Step 2: Recognize what needs to be proved next\n",
      "In many mathematical axiom systems, after establishing that a specific operation (such as addition with the given axiom) works for all numbers in general, the next step often involves proving properties of this operation. A common property is commutativity, which means the order of the operands doesn't change the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 3: Choose an example to demonstrate the proof\n",
      "To prove that the axiom implies another property (such as commutativity), let's consider a simple and specific case. We will use our given axiom to show that adding any number x to y (where y is also a constant) results in the same value regardless of whether we add x+y or y+x.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 4: Apply the given axiom\n",
      "Given our axiom, if we consider adding 0 (the additive identity) to any number y, we get y. So, according to our definition, y + 0 = y.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 5: Show the equivalence for an arbitrary number x added to y and vice versa\n",
      "To prove that addition is commutative, let's say we have two numbers, a specific example being x (which could be any number) and another number y. We know from our axiom that adding 0 to any number results in that same number.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 6: Realize the error in attempting to directly apply the given axiom for arbitrary x\n",
      "The direct application of the given axiom doesn't immediately help prove commutativity (x+y=y+x) because it's about showing that swapping x and y still results in the same sum, not just that adding a fixed value (0) does.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 7: Understand that the task was misinterpreted in steps 5-6\n",
      "The goal should be to take the given axiom as a basis for proving another property of addition (such as commutativity), but there seems to have been confusion in directly applying it towards this end.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 8: Acknowledge the correct approach to prove addition is commutative\n",
      "To correctly prove that x+y = y+x using our given axiom, we would consider arbitrary numbers x and y and show through substitution or another method how adding x to y results in the same value as adding y to x.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 9: Realize that steps 5-8 were overcomplicating a simpler task\n",
      "Given the axiom x + 0 = x, proving commutativity directly from this might not be necessary if we stick strictly to proving properties based on this definition without invoking other axioms or properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 10: Correctly identify the goal and approach\n",
